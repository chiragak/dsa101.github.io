          <p>Imagine you have a basket, and you want to collect different types of fruits in it. To keep track of the fruits you collect, you can use an array. An array is like a special container that can hold multiple items of the same type.</p>
          <p>Let's say you want to collect three types of fruits: apples, bananas, and oranges. You can create an array called fruitBasket in Java, which can hold these fruits.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">String[] fruitBasket = new String[3];</code></pre>
          <p>In this code, we declare an array called fruitBasket that can hold three strings (fruits). The new String[3] part tells Java that we want an array with three slots to store strings.</p>
          <p>Now, let's imagine you collect the fruits one by one and put them into the fruitBasket array. Here's how you would do it:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">fruitBasket[0] = "apple";
fruitBasket[1] = "banana";
fruitBasket[2] = "orange";</code></pre>
<p>In this code, we assign the value "apple" to the first slot of the fruitBasket array, "banana" to the second slot, and "orange" to the third slot.</p>
<p>Now, you can access the fruits from the fruitBasket array whenever you want. For example, if you want to get the fruit in the second slot (which is the banana), you can do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println("The second fruit in the basket is: " + fruitBasket[1]);</code></pre>
