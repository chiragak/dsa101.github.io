    <h1 class="outer-heading">Arrays</h1>
    <div class="inner-card">
      <p>Imagine you have a basket, and you want to collect different types of fruits in it. To keep track of the fruits
        you collect, you can use an array. An array is like a special container that can hold multiple items of the same
        type.</p>
      <p>Let's say you want to collect three types of fruits: apples, bananas, and oranges. You can create an array
        called <span class="bold-text">'fruitBasket'</span> in Java, which can hold these fruits.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-java">String[] fruitBasket = new String[3];</code></pre>
      <p>In this code, we declare an array called <span class="bold-text">'fruitBasket'</span> that can hold three
        strings (fruits). The <span class="bold-text">'new String[3]'</span> part tells Java that we want an array with
        three slots to store strings.</p>
      <p>Now, let's imagine you collect the fruits one by one and put them into the <span
          class="bold-text">'fruitBasket'</span> array. Here's how you would do it:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-java">fruitBasket[0] = "apple";
fruitBasket[1] = "banana";
fruitBasket[2] = "orange";</code></pre>
      <p>In this code, we assign the value <span class="bold-text">"apple"</span> to the first slot of the <span
          class="bold-text">'fruitBasket'</span> array, <span class="bold-text">"banana"</span> to the second slot, and
        <span class="bold-text">orange"</span> to the third slot.</p>
      <p>Now, you can access the fruits from the <span class="bold-text">'fruitBasket'</span> array whenever you want.
        For example, if you want to get the fruit in the second slot (which is the banana), you can do this:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println("The second fruit in the basket is: " + fruitBasket[1]);</code></pre>

      <h2>Passing Arrays as Arguments</h2>
      <p>When you pass an array as an argument in Java, it's like sharing your fruit basket with a friend. You tell
        them, "Hey, I have some delicious fruits in my basket. Would you like them?" They say, "Yes, please pass me your
        fruit basket." So you give them your fruit basket.<br>
        In Java, when you pass an array to a method or function, it's like sharing the contents of your array so that
        the method or function can use them.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-java">public static void shareFruits(String[] basket) {
    // The method receives the fruit basket as an argument
    // and can access the fruits inside it.
    for (String fruit : basket) {
      System.out.println("Shared fruit: " + fruit);
    }
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String[] myBasket = { "apple", "banana", "orange" };
    
    // Call the shareFruits method and pass your fruit basket (array) to it.
    shareFruits(myBasket);
  }</code></pre>
      <h2>Linear Search</h2>
      <p>Imagine you have a classroom with 30 students, and you're looking for a particular student named "Emma" in the
        class. You don't know where Emma is sitting, so you need to search through each student, one by one, until you
        find her.</p>

      <p>Here's how the linear search would work:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Start at the first student in the classroom.</li>
        <li>Ask the student, "Are you Emma?"</li>
        <li>If the student says, "Yes, I'm Emma," then you have found her!</li>
        <li>If the student says, "No, I'm not Emma," move on to the next student and repeat steps 2 and 3.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process until you either find Emma or you reach the last student in the classroom.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>This is an example of a linear search because you are searching through the students one by one, in a linear
        order, until you find the target student (Emma) or reach the end of the list.</p>

      <p>In programming, a linear search is similar. You have a list of elements, and you iterate through the list
        sequentially, comparing each element to the target until you find a match or reach the end of the list.</p>

      <p>Here's a simplified Java code snippet representing the linear search for Emma in the classroom:</p>

      <pre>
<code class="language-java">String[] students = { "Alice", "Bob", "Emma", "David" };
  // Array of student names
  
  for (int i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
    // Iterate through each student in the array
    if (students[i].equals("Emma")) {
      // Check if the current student is "Emma"
      System.out.println("Emma found sitting at position: " + i);
      // Print the position where Emma is found
    }
  }
</code>
</pre>


      <p>In this example, the <span class="bold-text">students</span> array represents the list of students' names. The
        code iterates through each student's name using a <span class="bold-text">for</span> loop and compares it to the
        target name "Emma". If a match is found, the program prints the position where Emma is found.</p>

      <p class="remember">
        Remember to note that when comparing strings in Java, we should use the <span class="bold-text">equals()</span>
        method instead of the <span class="bold-text">==</span> operator, as <span class="bold-text">==</span> compares
        the memory addresses of the objects rather than their contents.
