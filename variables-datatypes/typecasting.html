        <div class="inner-card">
         <p>Type casting is a method or process that converts a data type into another data type.</p>
         <p>There are two types of type casting:</p>
         <ol>
           <li>Widening Type Casting</li>
           <li>Narrowing Type Casting</li>
         </ol>
         <img class="design" src="images/Typecasting.svg" alt="" width="70%">
         <h2>Widening Type Casting</h2>
         <p>Widening type casting is when we convert a smaller data type to a larger data type. In this process, we don't lose any information.</p>
         <p>For example, converting an int to a float.</p>
         <pre><code class="language-java">int myInt = 9;
float myFloat = myInt;  // Automatic casting: int to float
System.out.println(myInt);   // Outputs 9
System.out.println(myFloat); // Outputs 9.0</code></pre>

         <h2>Narrowing Type Casting</h2>
         <p>Narrowing type casting is when we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type. In this process, we might lose some information.</p>
         <p>For example, converting a float to an int.</p>
         <pre><code class="language-java">float myFloat = 9.78f;
int myInt = (int) myFloat;  // Manual casting: float to int
System.out.println(myFloat);   // Outputs 9.78
System.out.println(myInt); // Outputs 9</code></pre>

    <p>Are you interested in learning how Java works exactly? </p>
    <p>Let's break it down:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>JDK (Java Development Kit):</strong> This is a software development environment used for developing Java applications. It includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>JRE (Java Runtime Environment):</strong> It provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application; it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and supporting files.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>JVM (Java Virtual Machine):</strong> This is what actually runs the Java programs. It takes the bytecode and translates it into machine code. Bytecode is a middle language between Java and the machine language. The JVM is also platform-dependent and provides core Java functions like memory management, garbage collection, security, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <img class="design"  src="images/jdkexplain.svg" alt="" width="70%">
    <h2>How is a .java file converted to machine level code?</h2>
    <p>When a .java file is compiled, it is converted into a .class file by the Java compiler (javac). This .class file contains bytecode, which is a platform-independent code that can be executed by any machine that has a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).</p>
    <p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a part of the JRE. When you run the Java program, the JVM is responsible for converting the bytecode into machine-specific code. This process is known as interpretation. The JVM interprets the bytecode line by line and converts it into machine code which is then executed by the machine.</p>
    <p>This is how a .java file is converted into machine level code and executed.</p>
    <h2>Why is Java platform independent?</h2>
    <p>Java is known as a "write once, run anywhere" language, which means that once you write your Java code and compile it into bytecode, that bytecode can run on any platform that has a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). This is because the JRE includes a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is capable of interpreting the bytecode and converting it into machine-specific code. This means you can write your Java code on one machine, and run it on any other machine - as long as it has a JRE installed. This platform independence is one of the key strengths of Java.</p>
